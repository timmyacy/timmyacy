### Hi there 👋


My name is Timmy and I am a computer science graduate working for a software company specialising in business solutions. I was born in Lagos,Nigeria. In 2013, I moved to the UK to study at Buckswood School where i completed my A Levels and proceeded to study Computer Science at the University of Plymouth. My final year project based on lane line detection systems using a camera input. I did earn the best project for my work which is currently a private repository on my account(due to licensing issues from University projects).After my studies, I managed to secure a Tier 2 sponsored Job which i am currently still in.

I am currently:


- 📖 studying at the Mathematical Finance at the University of York.
- 🔭 worked as graduate software engineer focusing on large datasets,maintenance of frontend systems,container orchestrations, file transfer and hybrid integration tools.
- 🖥 coding in Typescript, Python and Java.
- 📚 reading: Concepts of Mathematical Finance by Mark Joshi.
- 📺 watching: I am currently just rewatching [Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_(TV_series)) and not watching anything at the moment. If you have a good tv series let me know. 
- 🌱 learning: Regression Methods,Clustering and Time Series Analysis.
