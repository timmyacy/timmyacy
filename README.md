### Hi there 👋


My name is Timmy and I am a computer science graduate. I was born in Lagos,Nigeria. In 2013, I moved to the UK to study at Buckswood School where i completed my A Levels and proceeded to study Computer Science at the University of Plymouth. My final year project was lane detection system using a camera input. I did earn the best project for my work which is currently a private repository on my account(due to licensing issues from University projects).After my studies, I managed to secure a Tier 2 sponsored Job.

I am currently:

- 🔭  working as graduate software engineer focusing on large datasets,maintenance of frontend systems,container orchestrations, file transfer and hybrid integration tools.
- 🖥 coding in Typescript, Python and Java.
- 📚 reading: Nothing atm,just strictly reading for a pending CFA exam.
- 📺 watching: I just rewatching [Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_(TV_series) and not watching anything at the moment. If you have a good tv-series recommendation please let me know!
